Must call:
parser = new RTMLParser();
parser.init(false);   <- new method.
parser.parse(stuff).

RTMLCreate: Must have called RTMLDocument.setVersion(version) before calling create.
version: RTMLDocument.RTML_VERSION_22. RTMLDocument.RTML_VERSION_31.

To parse RTML 3.1a documents you have to be running Java v1.5 (JAXP v 1.2) for Schema parsing to work.

Should no longer use:
RTMLDocument document.getType() == "score" etc,etc , RTML v3.1a uses mode not type and "score" becomes "inquiry" etc.
See RTMLDocument, methods: isScoreRequest, isReject, isScoreReply, isRequest, isRequestConfirm, isUpdate, isFail, isIncomplete, isComplete.

Also, for setting return document types you can now use: setScoreRequest, setScoreReject, setScoreReply, setRequest, setRequestReply, setUpdate, setFail, setIncomplete, setComplete.

When modifying RTMLDocuments (i.e. on score/request) should add an RTMLHistoryEntry each time. Makes no difference for RTML v2.2, but will create History tree in v3.1a.

Unique IDs are more complicated. No longer extract from Intelligent Agent (RTML v2.2 only). Call
RTMLDocument.getUId(). This extract from intelligentAgent Data if available, but overwrites with RTMLDocument uid attribute if it has been filled in (by RTML v3.1a uid attribute).

IA return address: NodeAgent will have to look at RTMLIntelligentAgent.getUri which contains RTML v3.1a RespondTo data.
RTML v 2.2 parser still used RTMLIntelligentAgent.getHostname()/getPort() I think.
